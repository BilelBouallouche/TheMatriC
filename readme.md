# TheMatriC

It's just a personnal project to build my portfolio, learn C and apply what I've learned in maths class.
The code is bad, i'm not a developper, just a student in algebra.

## TODO 

### Error management system
- [ ] find a way

### Better code
- [ ] clean up
- [ ] better memory management
- [ ] no more french

### implementation idea
#### Linear algebra
- [x] basic vector representation
- [x] basic matrice representation
- [x] basic operations on vectors
- [x] basic operations on matrices
- [x] invert of a matrix
- [ ] case of infinite number of solutions in a linear system of equations 
- [ ] better inversion
- [ ] better linear system resolution
- [ ] karatsuba ?
- [x] LU decomposition
- [ ] solve system of equations with LU decomposition
- [ ] Diagonalization, eigenvalues, eigenvectors
