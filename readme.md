# TheMatriC

It's just a personnal project to build my portfolio, learn C and apply what I've learned in maths class.
The code may be bad, i'm not a developper, just a student in algebra.

## TODO 

### Error management system
- [ ] find a way

### Better code
- [ ] clean up
- [ ] better memory management
- [ ] no more french

### implementation idea
#### Linear algebra
    - [x] basic vector representation
    - [x] basic matrice representation
    - [x] basic operations on vectors
    - [x] basic operations on matrices
    - [ ] invert of a matrix
    - [ ] karatsuba ?
    - [ ] LU decomposition
    - [ ] Diagonalization, eigenvalues, eigenvectors
#### Z/nZ
    - [ ] representation
    - [ ] operations
    - [ ] GCD, LCM
    - [ ] CRT 

#### Polynomials
    - [ ] representation
    - [ ] operations
    - [ ] irreductibility tests ?
