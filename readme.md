# TheMatriC

It's just a personnal project to build my portfolio, learn C and apply what I've learned in maths class.
The code may be bad, i'm not a developper, just a student in algebra.

## TODO 

### Error management system
- [ ] find a way

### Better code
- [ ] clean up
- [ ] better memory management
- [ ] no more french

### implementation idea
#### Linear algebra
- [x] basic vector representation
- [x] basic matrice representation
- [x] basic operations on vectors
- [x] basic operations on matrices
- [ ] invert of a matrix
- [ ] karatsuba ?
- [ ] LU decomposition
- [ ] Diagonalization, eigenvalues, eigenvectors
#### Z/nZ
- [ ] representation
- [ ] operations
- [ ] GCD, LCM
- [ ] CRT 

#### Polynomials
- [ ] representation
- [ ] operations
- [ ] irreductibility tests ?
